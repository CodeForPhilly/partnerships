# First steps

\*\*\*\*[**ðŸ“£**](https://emojipedia.org/megaphone/)**: We have an** [**open projects co-lead role**](https://codeforphilly.org/pages/leadership-support_team_open_positions/#projects-lead) **on the Code for Philly leadership team.  In the meantime, contact leadership@codeforphilly.org for help with first steps!**

All partnerships involve two first steps:

* [ ] **Introduce** - reach out to Code for Philly's project co-lead. They will help you get started, and schedule a quick conversation with the partner.
* [ ] **Document** - ****during the introduction meeting, someone should fill out the [active project questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14_ca80-Ph9_WNyD99uXd2JuVZkCxEPqxEbtKjqo_mig/edit?usp=sharing) w/ collaborators. If the meeting is just for a friendly introduction, fill out the parts that seem relevant. For discussions on new meetup spaces, fill out the new space questionnaire.

For new active projects, the project co-lead will help with two more steps:

* [ ] **Setup** - create a [project page](https://codeforphilly.org/projects) and slack channel.
* [ ] **Plan** - list a small roadmap on your project page.
* [ ] **Rally** - schedule a hacknight for presenting.
