# Defining the partnership

Partnerships at Code for Philly help volunteers stay connected with important issues in the city, mobilize where support is needed, and ensure we can provide regular space for collaboration.

The first step of defining a partnership is deciding what kind of opportunity it might open up:

1. Relationship - you know of a non-profit with a compelling mission and want to raise awareness around it. They may not have an active project right now that requires volunteers, but need an introduction to Code for Philly leadership, or a single volunteer to coordinate sharing their mission at a meetup.
2. Active Project - what people often associate with Code for Philly. This is when volunteers are supporting a project run by a partner. Depending on the project's needs, it could many volunteers or only a single volunteer might be involved.
3. Sponsorship - sponsors enable Code for Philly to faciliate volunteer work through either \(a\) hosting weekly space for presentations, or \(b\) running larger events.
