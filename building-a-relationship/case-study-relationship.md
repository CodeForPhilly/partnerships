# Case study: RLadies relationship

### Who are RLadies Philly?

RLadies is an organization that "promotes gender diversity in the R community and in data science more broadly" \([website](https://www.rladiesphilly.org/)\). In additional to a community Slack, they hold monthly meetups, and collaborations with other organizations.

### How did we get in contact?

Marieke Jackson, who was leading a Code for Philly [project with Prevention Point](https://codeforphilly.org/projects/prevention_point_unified_reporting_system), met Karla Fettich at an RLadies meetup. Karla was an RLadies organizer and volunteer at Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society \(PAWS\).

### How did the relationship progress?

Eventually, Marieke heard about Karla's work at PAWS and wondered whether it was a good fit for Code for Philly. At this point, she had joined Code for Philly's leadership team. She and Michael Chow--projects co-lead at the time--set up a quick initial meeting, and scheduled PAWS to present at a hacknight!
